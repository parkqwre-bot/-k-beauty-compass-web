In the world of beauty, **Korean Glass Skin** stands out as the ultimate symbol of a healthy, radiant complexion. It’s not about heavy makeup or temporary fixes; it’s the result of a dedicated skincare routine that leaves your skin looking poreless, luminous, and translucent, just like a sheet of glass.

Achieving this coveted look requires consistency and the right products. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you on your journey to flawless glass skin.

### Step 1: The Double Cleanse
The foundation of any great Korean skincare routine is the double cleanse. This two-step process ensures your skin is perfectly clean and ready to absorb the products that follow.

*   **Oil-Based Cleanser:** Start by massaging an oil-based cleanser onto your dry face. This melts away makeup, sunscreen, and excess sebum without stripping your skin’s natural oils.
*   **Water-Based Cleanser:** Follow up with a gentle, water-based foaming cleanser. This removes any remaining impurities, leaving your skin feeling fresh and clean.

### Step 2: Gentle Exfoliation
To achieve that smooth, glass-like texture, you need to gently exfoliate 2-3 times a week. This removes dead skin cells that can cause dullness and clogged pores. Opt for a mild chemical exfoliant (like AHA or BHA) or a gentle physical scrub.

### Step 3: Hydrating Toner
Forget the harsh, alcohol-based toners of the past. A Korean hydrating toner is the first layer of moisture. Apply it to your face immediately after cleansing to balance your skin's pH and provide a surge of hydration. For an extra boost, try the "7 Skin Method," where you apply seven thin layers of toner.

### Step 4: Essence
An essence is the heart of the Korean skincare routine. This lightweight, concentrated formula is packed with hydrating and anti-aging ingredients that penetrate deep into the skin, promoting cellular repair and renewal.

### Step 5: Serum or Ampoule
Serums and ampoules are targeted treatments designed to address specific skin concerns, such as hyperpigmentation, fine lines, or acne. Choose one that aligns with your skin goals to give your routine a powerful, personalized boost.

### Step 6: Moisturizer
Next, lock in all that hydration with a good moisturizer. Look for a formula that suits your skin type—whether it's a lightweight lotion for oily skin or a richer cream for dry skin. This step creates a protective barrier, keeping moisture in and irritants out.

### Step 7: Sunscreen
The final, non-negotiable step is sunscreen. Protecting your skin from harmful UV rays is the most effective way to prevent premature aging, dark spots, and maintain that clear, even-toned complexion. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 50 every single morning.

### The Path to Radiance
Achieving glass skin is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency is key. By following these steps diligently, you'll nourish your skin from the inside out, revealing a complexion that is truly luminous and healthy.
