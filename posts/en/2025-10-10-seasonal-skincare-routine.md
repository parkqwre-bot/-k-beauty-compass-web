## What Happens to Our Skin During Changing Seasons?

Cool breezes in the morning and evening, warm sunshine during the day—the transitional season is here. These drastic changes in temperature and humidity can disrupt our skin's oil-water balance and weaken its outermost protective barrier. When the skin barrier is compromised, it becomes dry, sensitive to external stimuli, and prone to redness and breakouts.

During times like these, we need to focus on strengthening our skin's fundamental health—its barrier. K-Beauty, the Korean skincare routine loved worldwide, offers an excellent solution for maintaining a healthy skin barrier.

## A 5-Step K-Skincare Routine to Protect Your Skin Barrier

No more complicated and difficult skincare! Build resilient, healthy skin that can withstand the changing seasons with this essential 5-step routine.

### Step 1: Gently Cleanse with a Mild, Low-pH Cleanser

Harsh alkaline cleansers can strip away the skin's natural protective oils, leaving it even drier. Use a low-pH cleanser, similar to your skin's natural pH, to gently massage your face morning and night. It will leave the necessary moisture intact while removing only impurities, resulting in a hydrated, non-tight feeling after cleansing.

### Step 2: Open Up Hydration Pathways with a Moisturizing Toner

Immediately after cleansing, before your skin dries, apply a moisturizing toner. You can either wipe it gently across your skin with a cotton pad or pat it in multiple times with your hands. Layering the toner, like in the '7-skin method,' helps moisture penetrate deep into the skin and acts as a booster for the next products in your routine. Opt for toners containing ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid or Panthenol for an extra hydration boost.

### Step 3: Nourish with a Ceramide Ampoule/Serum

Apply a highly concentrated ampoule or serum rich in 'Ceramides,' a core component of the skin barrier. Ceramides make up the skin's lipid layer, preventing moisture evaporation and protecting it from harmful external factors. This is the most crucial step in rebuilding a compromised barrier and creating firm, resilient skin from within.

### Step 4: Lock in Moisture with a Rich Moisturizing Cream

Once the ampoule/serum is fully absorbed, it's time to seal everything in with a moisturizing cream. Especially at night, use a slightly thicker cream to lock in moisture and prevent your skin from drying out overnight. Products containing Shea Butter or Squalane are excellent for forming a powerful moisture-retaining barrier.

### Step 5: Protect Your Skin Daily with Sunscreen

The autumn sun might feel weaker than the summer sun, but UV rays are still attacking your skin. UV radiation is not only a primary cause of skin aging and pigmentation but also a major factor in damaging the skin barrier. Don't forget to apply sunscreen thoroughly 30 minutes before going out as the final step of your skincare routine.
