# Best Korean Vitamin C Serums for Brightening and Hyperpigmentation in 2026

Vitamin C is a powerhouse ingredient in Korean skincare, known for its ability to brighten the complexion, fade acne scars (PIH), and boost collagen production. However, finding a formula that is effective without being irritating can be a challenge.

In 2026, K-Beauty brands continue to innovate with stabilized Vitamin C derivatives and soothing botanical ingredients. Here are our top picks for the best Korean Vitamin C serums.

## 1. Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Care Serum
A cult favorite for a reason. This serum uses green tangerine extract (which contains 10x more Vitamin C than lemons) to gently fade dark spots. It's a gel-type serum that absorbs quickly and is suitable for sensitive skin.

*   **Key Ingredients:** Green Tangerine Extract, Niacinamide, Arbutin
*   **Best For:** Dark spots, dullness, sensitive skin

## 2. Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop
Perfect for Vitamin C beginners. With a low concentration of pure Vitamin C (5%), it provides brightening effects without the stinging sensation often associated with higher percentages. It also contains Centella Asiatica to soothe the skin.

*   **Key Ingredients:** 5% L-Ascorbic Acid, Centella Asiatica
*   **Best For:** Sensitive skin, beginners

## 3. COSRX The Vitamin C 23 Serum
For those who need something stronger, this serum packs a punch with 23% pure Vitamin C. It effectively targets deep hyperpigmentation and fine lines. Because of its high potency, it's recommended to start slowly and use it with a moisturizer.

*   **Key Ingredients:** 23% Ascorbic Acid, Super Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid
*   **Best For:** Stubborn dark spots, anti-aging

## 4. Jumiso All Day Vitamin Brightening & Balancing Facial Serum
This non-water-based serum is rich in vitamin extracts from sea buckthorn and centella. It helps balance oil production while brightening the skin tone. It's lightweight and great for oily or acne-prone skin.

*   **Key Ingredients:** Sea Buckthorn Extract, Niacinamide
*   **Best For:** Oily/Combo skin, overall brightening

## How to Use Vitamin C in Your Routine
1.  **Morning is Best:** Vitamin C boosts your sunscreen's protection against UV damage.
2.  **Store Properly:** Pure Vitamin C can oxidize. Keep it in a cool, dark place or the fridge.
3.  **Don't Mix with Retinol/AHA/BHA:** Use Vitamin C in the morning and exfoliants/retinols at night to avoid irritation.
