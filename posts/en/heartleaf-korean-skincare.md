If there is one ingredient that has absolutely dominated Korean Olive Young rankings recently, it is **Heartleaf** (Houttuynia Cordata), known as *Eoseongcho* (어성초) in Korea.

While Cica (Centella Asiatica) was the king of soothing for years, Heartleaf has emerged as the new champion for those dealing with acne, maskne (mask-induced acne), and hypersensitivity.

### What is Heartleaf?

Heartleaf is a flavonoid-rich herb native to Southeast Asia. Historically, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its medicinal properties. In skincare, the extract from its leaves is prized for its potent anti-inflammatory and antibacterial capabilities.

### Key Benefits of Heartleaf

1.  **Powerful Detoxification:** Heartleaf is known to help clear out toxins from the skin, which can result in a clearer, more radiant complexion.
2.  **Anti-Inflammatory & Soothing:** It excels at calming angry, red, and irritated skin. If you have a breakout that feels hot or painful, Heartleaf can bring that temperature down.
3.  **Sebum Control:** Unlike some stripping ingredients, Heartleaf helps balance oil production without drying out the skin, making it perfect for oily and dehydrated skin types.
4.  **Antibacterial:** It fights the bacteria that causes acne, making it an effective preventive measure against future breakouts.

### Who Should Use It?

Heartleaf is generally safe for all skin types, but it is a "holy grail" ingredient for:
*   **Acne-prone skin:** To calm active breakouts.
*   **Sensitive skin:** To reduce redness and irritation.
*   **Oily/Combination skin:** To regulate sebum.

### How to Incorporate It

You can find Heartleaf in almost every step of a K-Beauty routine now:
*   **Toners:** The most popular way to use it. The *Anua Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner* is a viral best-seller for a reason.
*   **Pads:** Heartleaf toner pads are excellent for a quick soothing mask pack on your cheeks.
*   **Cleansers:** A Heartleaf oil cleanser can help remove makeup without clogging pores.

If your skin feels stressed, red, or on the verge of a breakout, switching your toner to a Heartleaf-based one might be the game-changer you need.
