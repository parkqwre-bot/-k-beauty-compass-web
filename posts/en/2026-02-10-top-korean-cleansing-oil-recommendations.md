## Why Korean Cleansing Oils Are a Must-Have

Korean cleansing oils have revolutionized the first step of skincare routines worldwide. Unlike traditional cleansers, these oil-based formulas effortlessly dissolve makeup, sunscreen, and impurities without stripping the skin's natural moisture barrier. They are the cornerstone of the popular double-cleansing method, ensuring a truly clean canvas for subsequent skincare steps.

### The Science Behind Oil Cleansing

Oil attracts oil. This simple principle is why cleansing oils are so effective. The oil in the cleanser binds to the oil-based impurities on your skin, such as sebum, makeup, and pollutants. When water is added, the oil emulsifies into a milky texture, allowing it to be easily rinsed away, taking all the impurities with it. This leaves your skin feeling soft, hydrated, and thoroughly clean, not tight or dry.
