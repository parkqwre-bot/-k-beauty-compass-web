### For Dry Skin
Dry skin lacks both oil and moisture, leading to frequent dryness, flakiness, and fine lines. From the cleansing step, choose a gentle cream or oil-type cleanser. Immediately after washing, you must use a toner, essence, and a high-moisture cream that supply both oil and water. Ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramides, and Glycerin are effective in relieving dryness. Avoid products containing alcohol, harsh surfactants, or acidic ingredients.

### For Oily Skin
Oily skin has excessive sebum production, leading to shine and frequent troubles like blackheads and acne. Wash your face about twice a day with a foam cleanser and lukewarm water. A refreshing toner with pore-tightening ingredients like Witch Hazel or Salicylic Acid is recommended. Don't skip moisturizing; a light gel-type or oil-free product is ideal. Limit exfoliation to 1-2 times a week to reduce irritation. Avoid comedogenic ingredients like coconut oil.

### For Combination Skin
Combination skin features both oily areas (T-zone: forehead, nose) and dry areas (U-zone: cheeks, chin). The key is to care for each area differently. Use a toner and light moisturizer for oily skin on the T-zone, and a cream or oil for dry skin on the U-zone. Having two types of products for balance allows for easy adjustments depending on the season and your skin's condition.

### For Sensitive Skin
Sensitive skin easily becomes red, irritated, and itchy in response to external stimuli. Prioritize hypoallergenic, alcohol-free, and fragrance-free products. Always check the ingredient list for soothing components like Chamomile, Aloe Vera, and Panthenol. Pursuing a simple routine with minimal ingredients from cleansing to moisturizing is key to preventing skin troubles. Patch testing new products is a must.
