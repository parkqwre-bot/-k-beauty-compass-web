The Korean skincare routine is famous worldwide for its focus on achieving healthy, glowing skin. While the 10-step routine might sound intimidating, it's a customizable framework you can adapt to your skin's needs. This guide will break down the core steps for beginners.

### The Core Philosophy

Korean skincare is not just about products; it's about a gentle, consistent approach. The goal is to nourish and protect your skin, not strip it with harsh chemicals. Hydration is key!
