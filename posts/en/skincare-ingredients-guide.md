When choosing skincare products, one of the most important criteria is the 'ingredients'. This guide details the effects of key ingredients for each skin concern, tips for use, and how to select products based on those ingredients.

### 1. Moisturizing Ingredients
**Hyaluronic Acid**
A representative moisturizing ingredient that holds moisture in the skin and prevents evaporation. It's light but has a powerful moisturizing effect, suitable for both dry and oily skin.

**Glycerin**
Attracts external moisture to the skin, increasing moisture retention. Commonly found in most toners, essences, and creams.

**Ceramide**
Strengthens the skin barrier and protects the skin from external stimuli. Suitable for sensitive and dry skin.

**How to choose:**
For dry skin, a rich cream containing hyaluronic acid and ceramide is recommended. For oily/sensitive skin, an oil-free/hypoallergenic moisturizer is a great choice.

### 2. Exfoliating and Trouble-Care Ingredients
**Salicylic Acid (BHA)**
Effective for troubled skin such as acne and blackheads by dissolving dead skin cells and impurities inside pores. It can cause dryness if used too often, so use a moderate amount 1-2 times a week.

**AHA (Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, etc.)**
Gently melts dead skin cells to even out skin texture. Beginners should start with low-concentration products.

**How to choose:**
For acne-prone/oily skin, consider a salicylic acid toner, enzyme powder, or AHA serum. For sensitive skin, be sure to check the BHA/AHA concentration.

### 3. Brightening and Blemish-Care Ingredients
**Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**
An antioxidant effective for improving pigmentation, blemishes, and dullness. When used in the morning, always follow up with sunscreen.

**Niacinamide**
Evens out skin tone and provides blemish relief and soothing effects simultaneously.

**How to choose:**
If you're concerned about spots and blemishes, choose a Vitamin C serum or Niacinamide ampoule, but start with a low concentration to avoid irritation or stinging.

### 4. Elasticity and Wrinkle-Care Ingredients
**Retinol**
The most widely used ingredient for improving wrinkles and promoting collagen production. As it is potent, it's important to start with a low concentration and slowly acclimate to prevent side effects.

**Peptides**
A next-generation ingredient that helps repair damaged skin cells and improve elasticity.

**How to choose:**
If you're concerned about aging or sagging, use products with retinol or peptides in the evening, and be thorough with sun protection the next day.

### 5. Soothing/Sensitive Skincare Ingredients
**Aloe Vera, Chamomile**
Quickly soothes irritated skin and reduces redness and heat.

**Panthenol**
Strengthens the damaged skin barrier and has a soothing effect.

**How to choose:**
If you have redness, sensitivity, or dermatitis, use a hypoallergenic essence or cream containing pure natural ingredients.
