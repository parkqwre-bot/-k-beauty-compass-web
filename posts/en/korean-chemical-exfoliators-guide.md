Achieving the coveted "Glass Skin" look isn't just about hydration—it's about having a smooth, clear canvas. That's where exfoliation comes in. While Western beauty often relied on harsh scrubs (physical exfoliation), K-Beauty has long championed the gentler, more effective approach of chemical exfoliation.

But with acronyms like AHA, BHA, PHA, and LHA floating around, it can be confusing to know which one is right for your skin type. In this guide, we break down these exfoliating acids and how to incorporate them into your Korean skincare routine.

## Why Choose Chemical Exfoliation?

Physical scrubs can cause micro-tears in the skin barrier, leading to irritation and sensitivity. Chemical exfoliators, on the other hand, use acids to dissolve the "glue" that holds dead skin cells together, allowing them to slough off naturally. This reveals brighter, smoother skin underneath and helps your other skincare products absorb better.

## The ABCs of Acids

### 1. AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid)
**Best for:** Dry, sun-damaged, or aging skin.
**Common types:** Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid.

AHAs are water-soluble acids derived from sugary fruits. They work on the skin's surface to melt away dead skin cells.
*   **Benefits:** Brightens dull skin, fades hyperpigmentation, smoothes fine lines, and hydrates.
*   **K-Beauty Tip:** Look for toners containing 7% Glycolic Acid or gentle Lactic Acid serums for a "glow-from-within" look.

### 2. BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid)
**Best for:** Oily, acne-prone, and combination skin.
**Common types:** Salicylic Acid, Betaine Salicylate.

Unlike AHAs, BHAs are oil-soluble, meaning they can penetrate deep into the pores to clear out excess sebum and dead skin.
*   **Benefits:** Unclogs pores, treats blackheads and whiteheads, reduces inflammation.
*   **K-Beauty Tip:** Many Korean BHA products use Betaine Salicylate, a gentler alternative to Salicylic Acid that is just as effective but less irritating.

### 3. PHA (Poly Hydroxy Acid)
**Best for:** Sensitive skin and those new to acids.
**Common types:** Gluconolactone, Lactobionic Acid.

PHAs are the "cousins" of AHAs. They work similarly but have much larger molecular structures, meaning they penetrate the skin slower and don't go as deep.
*   **Benefits:** Gentle exfoliation, hydration, strengthens the skin barrier.
*   **K-Beauty Tip:** PHA peeling pads are a popular daily exfoliation step in Korea for sensitive skin types.

### 4. LHA (Lipohydroxy Acid)
**Best for:** Very sensitive, acne-prone skin.
**Common types:** Capryloyl Salicylic Acid.

LHA is a derivative of Salicylic Acid (BHA). It has a pH close to the skin's natural levels and penetrates very slowly.
*   **Benefits:** Non-irritating, anti-comedogenic (won't clog pores), precise exfoliation.
*   **K-Beauty Tip:** LHA is becoming a superstar ingredient in Korean cleansers and toners for a mild, daily detox.

## How to Incorporate Them into Your Routine

1.  **Start Slow:** If you're new to acids, start using them 1-2 times a week and gradually increase frequency.
2.  **Don't Over-Exfoliate:** More isn't always better. Over-exfoliation can damage your skin barrier.
3.  **Check Interactions:** Be careful mixing acids with Retinol or Vitamin C. It's often safer to use acids in the evening and Vitamin C in the morning, or alternate nights.
4.  **Sunscreen is Non-Negotiable:** AHAs and BHAs can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Always apply a high SPF Korean sunscreen every morning.

## Conclusion

Chemical exfoliators are powerful tools in the K-Beauty arsenal. Whether you need to declog pores with BHA or brighten your complexion with AHA, there's an acid for every skin concern. Listen to your skin, choose the right ingredient, and get ready to reveal your smoothest, clearest skin yet.
