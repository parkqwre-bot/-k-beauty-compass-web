## What is Korean Double Cleansing?

Double cleansing is the cornerstone of the Korean skincare routine. It involves using two different types of cleansers back-to-back to ensure your skin is thoroughly clean. This method is crucial because different types of impurities require different solvents to dissolve them.

The two steps are:
1.  **Oil-Based Cleanser:** Removes oil-based impurities like makeup, sunscreen, and excess sebum.
2.  **Water-Based Cleanser:** Removes water-based impurities like sweat, dirt, and residue from the oil cleanser.

## Why Should You Double Cleanse?

If you only use a foam cleanser, you might be leaving behind sunscreen or waterproof makeup, which can clog pores and lead to breakouts. Conversely, if you only use an oil cleanser, you might leave an oily residue. Double cleansing ensures a perfectly clean canvas for the rest of your skincare products.

### Benefits:
*   **Deep Pore Cleaning:** Prevents acne and blackheads by removing sebum plugs.
*   **Better Product Absorption:** Serums and moisturizers penetrate better on clean skin.
*   **Gentle on Skin:** Avoids the need for harsh scrubbing or stripping cleansers.

## Step 1: The Oil Cleanser (or Balm)

Start with dry hands and a dry face. Massage the oil cleanser onto your skin for about 60 seconds. This breaks down makeup and sunscreen. Emulsify with a little water (it will turn milky), then rinse off.

**Popular Types:**
*   **Cleansing Oils:** Great for all skin types, especially dry skin.
*   **Cleansing Balms:** Solid oils that melt on skin; travel-friendly and luxurious.
*   **Micellar Water:** A lighter option for very sensitive skin or light makeup days (though oil is generally preferred for a true double cleanse).

## Step 2: The Water-Based Cleanser

Follow up with a foam, gel, or cream cleanser. Massage onto damp skin to remove any remaining impurities and the oil residue.

**How to Choose:**
*   **Low pH Cleansers:** Best for maintaining the skin barrier (pH 5.5).
*   **Foam Cleansers:** Good for oily/combo skin for a deep clean.
*   **Gel/Cream Cleansers:** Better for dry or sensitive skin.

## Common Myths

**"Oil cleansers will make my oily skin worse."**
False! Oil dissolves oil. An oil cleanser is actually one of the best ways to remove excess sebum from oily skin without stripping it.

**"I don't wear makeup, so I don't need to double cleanse."**
If you wear sunscreen (which you should!), you still need an oil cleanser to remove it effectively. Sunscreen is designed to stick to your skin and is often oil-soluble.

## Conclusion

Double cleansing is a simple yet transformative step that can dramatically improve your skin's texture and clarity. By taking the extra minute to cleanse properly, you set the foundation for a healthy, glowing complexion.
