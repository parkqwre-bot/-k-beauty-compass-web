Human skin is broadly composed of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer, playing a crucial role in protecting the body from external stimuli and preventing moisture evaporation. This layer contains keratinocytes, which form the skin barrier, and melanocytes, which determine skin color. The dermis is rich in collagen and elastin, maintaining the skin's elasticity and strength, and contains blood vessels, nerves, and hair follicles. Finally, the hypodermis helps prevent heat loss and protects the body from external impacts, also serving as an energy source. If the balance of these three layers is disrupted, skin troubles and aging can be accelerated, making proper care for each layer essential for healthy skin.

Characteristics and Diagnosis of Skin Types
Skin types are generally classified based on the amount of oil and moisture secretion, and skin sensitivity. They are typically categorized into dry, oily, combination, and sensitive skin.

Dry Skin
Lacks both moisture and oil, causing the skin to easily crack and feel tight. It's best to avoid products with high alcohol content or strong cleansing power. Products containing excellent moisturizing ingredients like shea butter, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid are recommended.

Oily Skin
Characterized by excessive sebum secretion, leading to shininess and frequent breakouts. Avoid heavy creams or products rich in oil, and opt for refreshing gel-type moisturizers and exfoliating ingredients like salicylic acid.

Combination Skin
Often has an oily forehead and nose (T-zone) and dry cheeks and eye areas, requiring customized care for different areas. Choose products that allow for partial application, such as light serums for oil-prone areas and creams for dry areas.

Sensitive Skin
Reacts easily to external stimuli, often resulting in redness and itching. Low-irritation products with minimal irritating ingredients like fragrances, alcohol, and parabens are recommended. Products containing soothing ingredients like aloe vera and chamomile extract are beneficial.

For accurate skin typing, using professional skin diagnostic equipment is the most precise method. A simple self-diagnosis method involves observing your skin's condition 1-2 hours after washing your face. If your skin feels tight or rough after washing, it's likely dry; if it's shiny, it's likely oily.

The Importance and Effects of Skincare
Skin plays a vital role in protecting the body from the external environment and regulating body temperature. Healthy skin acts as a barrier against external pathogens, and proper moisture balance and oil control are essential. Consistent skincare strengthens the skin barrier, increasing resistance to irritation, and can induce positive changes such as preventing aging, alleviating troubles, and improving skin tone, directly impacting skin health and beauty.

Through a proper skincare routine, you can reduce skin stress from various external stimuli like yellow dust, fine dust, and UV rays, and promote skin regeneration, greatly contributing to maintaining healthy and firm skin.
